### Things I have learned

#### Here are few things I learned along the way in the last 11 years [some of this I wish someone would have told me before I started working], and I thought I would share with you, and some of it may help in your future careers:

## High-level Professional [LinkedIn, Google+]
1. Get a LinkedIn account, and keep it updated

2. Get out to the local meetups [meetup.com] and connect with people you meet on LinkedIn

3. When working with someone, connect with them, and when they praise you, request their specific recommendation on LinkedIn, after you connect with them (this is before they forget that you did something good)

4. Every 4 - 6 months reach out to everyone on your network or clients you recently worked with and connect, request time to meet over coffee, reach out and see how they are doing.

5. Post articles you read online [professional ones], or follow people you want to be like (Donald Trump, Jack Welch, Richard Branson, Jeff Weiner, etc) and re-post their articles that you agree with, BUT with your own comments on LinkedIn, and connect your Twitter, Google+ accounts, so you can easily cross-post from LinkedIn to there as well..

6. Keep things on Google+ either strictly professional or semi-professional, it will come back to haunt you..

## Detailed/Technical Professional [Twitter, Google+]
1. Get a Twitter account

2. Start following interesting and influential people

3. Post articles that aren't professional but cool (like if you are web designer, post web designer articles, if a developer, developer articles, etc) [some people use LinkedIn in a semi-professional manner as well, but I chose to keep it high-level, articles that executives would understand]

4. If you are developer, get a Github account, like now, or wait, 2 months ago! Github is quickly becoming the standard of judging your technical skill, post homework assignments (so Andrei or Dima or I can help you as well), post interesting side projects (that aren't secret apps), fork other people's repositories and contribute code, contribute even a simple fix, this is a must!! What are you waiting for? You didn't get a Github account yet? Go.. This email can wait... Go... seriously!

5. If you are designer, get a Dribbble.com and a Behance.net account, start following people you like, start posting your designs on there.. 

6. If you are a human, practice, practice, practice, post designs and code even if its not great.. it doesnt matter.. (at first) eventually you will take down some of your work.. but for now, post, post, post.. homework assignments, sketches, experiments (even if they dont work), anything that can show your skills and more importantly, your progress..

## Personal [Facebook, Instagram, Google Voice]
1. Anyone still use Facebook? just kidding..

2. This is personal space, I would highly recommend applying some privacy settings.. And change your name on Facebook, make something up.. Abbr (Abbreviate) etc.. Trust me on this.. Go through your friend list, and remove people that you dont remember anymore.. Personally, I chose to stick with just family or closely related people..

3. Same thing for Instagram.. protect your images, there are several websites out there that will cache everything you post.. forever.. good luck trying to remove it.. Tweak the settings of your Instagram app to post privately..

4. Get a Google Voice number, and give that number out instead of your personal.. except to trusted people..

5. Go and google your name, you will be surprised what you find.. Hopefully it will help you change your online habits..

6. Dont post stupid things anywhere online.. "Someday you will be tempted to do this despite your high intelligence. It is risky and could ruin your teenage/college/adult life. It is always a bad idea. Cyberspace is vast and more powerful than you. And it is hard to make anything of this magnitude disappear -- including a bad reputation." - [iPhone contract story](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/janell-burley-hofmann/iphone-contract-from-your-mom_b_2372493.html)

7. Dont post personal things to LinkedIn, Twitter is up in the air, tread carefully.. (remember that there are companies that are pulling all the Twitter data into big [25GB, and more] caches and then selling the data to companies)

## Monitoring [Klout.com, Vizify.com, Google searching]
1. Fill out these profiles for Klout.com and Vizify.com, so you can control what shows up there, instead of someone else controlling it

2. Every couple months, do Google Search for your name, if you find something that you dont like, there is a possibility of getting it removed, but most likely not.. 

3. Don't pay attention to anything negative that someone may post about you.. Keep your emotions under control

## General
1. Don't be afraid to ask for help, its not a sign of weakness

2. Don't be afraid to ask about anything in general

3. Don't email things at work that will get you in trouble, no matter how angry you are, wait an hour, or a day, or just send the email to your boss for review so he/she can edit it.. (unless you are angry at your boss) or in most cases, dont send anything at all..

4. if you must have a heated discussion about something at work, call the person instead of emailing them, that way there is no record

5. unless you want a record the conversation legally, then after a meeting or a phone call, email the person with the things that were discussed, thereby creating a record of something happening (especially, if the person talking to you was in the wrong, no matter how high up the chain they are)

6. Start paying attention to your body language (watch this video: [Body language with Alan Pease](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw36-ByXuMw))

7. Start paying attention to your handshake, it shows confidence

8. Start smiling while people are talking to you and on the phone (I know this sounds funny, but it works, trust me), it will make you more friendly..

9. Start paying attention to your umms.., wells.. and uhhs, take a pause while thinking dont answer right away, better yet, repeat the question as a full sentence back to the person while you are thinking about the answer.. and then answer slowing and calculated..

10. When asked your opinion, or a response to something, try to sandwich (Positive-Negative-Positive) the critique: Positive: you did that design really quickly Negative: Have you thought about using a different font Positive: Btw, I love your use of whitespace or negative space

11. When describing things, or technical details, try sticking to three points, if the person is interested, they will ask you to expand on it (watch this video: [How to pitch anything in 15 seconds](http://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2012/07/17/how-to-pitch-anything-in-15-seconds/))

12. Question things when they dont make sense to you or if you disagree, you will save yourself some stress
